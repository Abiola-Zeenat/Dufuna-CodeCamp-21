Hi, my name is Joshua Oke.
I have been in and out of writing codes for a space of about three years without any real progress, largely becuase there has been no way
to really track if I have been making progress or not.

At the end of this program, I intend to become a solid full stack developer, become more confident with my coding skills and apply for well-paying jobs.
I hope to be really good at this at the end of the day.

I also intend to build a solid portfolio from the things I'd learn here so I can apply for jobs and maybe even freelance.
